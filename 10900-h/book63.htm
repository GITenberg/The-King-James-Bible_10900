<h1 align="center">2 John</h1>

<p>1:1 The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in
the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known
the truth;</p>

<p>1:2 For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with
us for ever.</p>

<p>1:3 Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and
from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth
and love.</p>

<p>1:4 I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in
truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</p>

<p>1:5 And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new
commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the
beginning, that we love one another.</p>

<p>1:6 And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is
the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye
should walk in it.</p>

<p>1:7 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and
an antichrist.</p>

<p>1:8 Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we
have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</p>

<p>1:9 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of
Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of
Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</p>

<p>1:10 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine,
receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:</p>

<p>1:11 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil
deeds.</p>

<p>1:12 Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with
paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to
face, that our joy may be full.</p>

<p>1:13 The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.</p>
