<h1 align="center">Titus</h1>

<p align="center" >Chapter</p><a href="#2" >2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="#3" >3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>1:1 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging
of the truth which is after godliness;</p>

<p>1:2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised
before the world began;</p>

<p>1:3 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching,
which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God
our Saviour;</p>

<p>1:4 To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy,
and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our
Saviour.</p>

<p>1:5 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set
in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in
every city, as I had appointed thee:</p>

<p>1:6 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful
children not accused of riot or unruly.</p>

<p>1:7 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not
selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not
given to filthy lucre;</p>

<p>1:8 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just,
holy, temperate;</p>

<p>1:9 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he
may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince
the gainsayers.</p>

<p>1:10 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,
specially they of the circumcision:</p>

<p>1:11 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses,
teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</p>

<p>1:12 One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The
Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</p>

<p>1:13 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they
may be sound in the faith;</p>

<p>1:14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men,
that turn from the truth.</p>

<p>1:15 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are
defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind
and conscience is defiled.</p>

<p>1:16 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him,
being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work
reprobate.</p>

<a name="2" /></a><p>2:1 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</p>

<p>2:2 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith,
in charity, in patience.</p>

<p>2:3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers
of good things;</p>

<p>2:4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their
husbands, to love their children,</p>

<p>2:5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to
their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</p>

<p>2:6 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</p>

<p>2:7 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in
doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</p>

<p>2:8 Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the
contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of
you.</p>

<p>2:9 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to
please them well in all things; not answering again;</p>

<p>2:10 Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may
adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</p>

<p>2:11 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
all men,</p>

<p>2:12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
world;</p>

<p>2:13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of
the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</p>

<p>2:14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous
of good works.</p>

<p>2:15 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.
Let no man despise thee.</p>

<a name="3" /></a><p>3:1 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers,
to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</p>

<p>3:2 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle,
shewing all meekness unto all men.</p>

<p>3:3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice
and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</p>

<p>3:4 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward
man appeared,</p>

<p>3:5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of
regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</p>

<p>3:6 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
Saviour;</p>

<p>3:7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs
according to the hope of eternal life.</p>

<p>3:8 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou
affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might
be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and
profitable unto men.</p>

<p>3:9 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions,
and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and
vain.</p>

<p>3:10 A man that is an heretick after the first and second
admonition reject;</p>

<p>3:11 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being
condemned of himself.</p>

<p>3:12 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent
to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to
winter.</p>

<p>3:13 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey
diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</p>

<p>3:14 And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary
uses, that they be not unfruitful.</p>

<p>3:15 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in
the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
